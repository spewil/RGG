## Generation and Control Analysis of Spatially Embedded Networks 

This is an ongoing project to explore the control-theoretic principles of Random Geometric Graphs, now usually referred to as Spatially Embedded Networks. 

To use this code, download it and run the command 

```python
python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
```

to generate the `.so` files. To play around, check out the file:

```python 
test.py
```

Thanks for looking!
